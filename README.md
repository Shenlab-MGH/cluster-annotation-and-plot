Clustered rotatory pattern annotations:
We are using a semi-auto tools to annotate and track the cluster pattern of the two-photon recording.
It's a simple GUI you can skip frames, last and next frame for both tif and avi files.
just click 4 points around the cluster to define an oval shape, and plot by the plotting file.
